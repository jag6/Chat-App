# Video-Conferencing-App

This is a simple video conferencing web application with additional text-message functionality. 

## Setup
- Conferencing takes place inside of a "room". 
- A new room number is automatically generated each time a user visits the homepage. 
- Users can only use the video and message functions once they've entered the correct email and password. 
- Users can only communicate with other users belonging to the same room. 
- In order to invite someone to your room, you must send a copy of your url over to them.
